# Mixed Messages

A fun JavaScript project that generates random, quirky messages using a cast of unique characters and their jokes. Each run produces a new combination of character, bio, and a three-part joke.

## Features

- 10 original characters, each with a bio
- 30+ joke sets, randomized for variety
- Simple, readable code structure
- Console output for easy testing

## How It Works

- Randomly selects a character and their bio
- Randomly assembles a three-sentence joke from the joke pool
- Outputs the result in the console

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node index.js` in your terminal.
3. Enjoy a new mixed message every time!
